                <p>
                Chess is a game of strategy between 2 players which is played on a board. One player plays as the black pieces while the other player plays as the white piece. The goal of the game is to 'checkmate' the other opponent or make the opponent resign. Checkmate refers to when one of the players surrounds the the other player's king not allowing him to move anywhere otherwise the king would be taken.

                Pawn is a piece which on it's first move can either move one square or two squares and after its first move can only move one square forward but cannot capture any pieces in front of it. A pawn can only capture pieces one square diagnally in front of it. Its also the only piece which cannot move backwards after its moves forward. If it gets to the other side of the board it can turn into any piece you choose.

                The Queen can move and capture pieces diagonally,horizontally and vertically. The piece is a combination of the rook and the bishop and is the most powerful piece on the board.
