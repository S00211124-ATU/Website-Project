                The London System
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The London system is an opening for white and it is a "system" based opening which means it can be played against any of black's openings. The opening starts with the moves 1.d4 and 2.Bf4 3.e3 and can go in many direction from there but it usually ends up looking something like this:

                The Caro-Kann Defence
                </h2>
                    <p>
                    The Caro-Kann Defence is characterized by the moves 1.e4 c6 and usually continuing with 2.d4 d5 from here on it could go into dozen different positions. This is the standard setup:

                The Kings Indian Defence
                </h2>
                    <p>
                    The Kings Indian Defence starts with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6. In this opening you let white take the center much earlier than you normally would but in return your position is very solid and hard to attack. This is how it looks in-game:
